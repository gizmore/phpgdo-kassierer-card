    'kk_faq_b1a' => '%s is a service, and art project, to honor the cashiers and workers in the real economy.<br/>
It is similiar to a tip or a thank you.<br/>
Also it is the baptism of fire for my programming work.<br/>
KassiererCard.org has an interesting reward system,
and we hope it is fun to earn Stars, browse the site and redeem some of the Offers,<br/>
like getting a beer, a haircut, a kebab or a coffee.<br/>
In crazy times, maybe a thank you and a smile is more valuable than ever.<br/>
We are transparent and indipendant, and have kinda charity plans for the future.',
    
	'kk_faq_t1b' => 'Why do you do this?',
	'kk_faq_b1b' => 'Fame and money :)<br/>
The project is kinda fun and perfect for my own software.<br/>
Also we wanna move something!<br/>
Please help us to bring some power to the people.<br/>',

	'kk_faq_t1c' => 'How do you finance this?',
	'kk_faq_b1c' => 'We try to get to some critical mass and a fun site quickly.<br/>
until then, the costs are tightly calculated, and covored from a guy named gizmore :)<br/>
Currently we have 0 expenses for servers and programming,
and 100% of the marketing capital ends in the Offers; Well, except a few beers with the team.<br/>
He hopes to bring some joy and a smile to your days at work.',

We do not collect any information from you, beside an email,
some logs,

Customer, Cashier and Company.
Let\'s call them the three C\'s; CEO, Christian and Charlette.<br/>
Customers can print (and write down) Coupons.<br/>
The Cashiers and workers can enter them to collect stars.<br/>
Customers also get some stars (diamonds) when they invite people or give cards to the workers.<br/>
The Companies Offer goods for the stars and also get Diamonds in return.
Those are for competitions and rankings.',

Print Coupons and hand them to the Cashiers and workers you like.<br/>

You can either print a Coupon, write the code down,
or use mobile phones to transfer codes to the workers.<br/>
You will get a diamond for every %sth star a worker enters from you.',

Currently only admins can invite Cashiers individually, but this will change in Phase-2.<br/>
For now we try to cover Peine and maybe one or two other cities in the first run.<br/>
If you like the idea, send invitations to your Customers. - Customers do not need a signup code.<br/>
You will get handed Coupons from your Customers that you can trade for goods from the Companies.<br/>
This can be done via exchanging a Coupon-Code, or scanning a QR-Code.<br/>
We hope you enjoy this a little!',

    'kk_faq_t5' => 'The Company Cookbook',
    'kk_faq_b5' => 'Last but not least, there are Companies.<br/>
Your job is to give your workers a bit money and products.<br/>
In exchange you will get 100% off the backside of every printed KassiererCard,<br/>
a merchandize platform that is not poisoned with bloated metrics.<br/>',

    'kk_faq_t6' => 'Pizza and Cola is lame, i want better stuff for my Coupons!',
    'kk_faq_b6' => 'For every Coupon redeemed, your userlevel will advance by one point.<br/>

add links to this site, create polls, and do other stuff.<br/>',

    'kk_faq_b7' => 'No, you can only get goods or discounts,
or virtual stuff like creating polls or advertisements.<br/>

Ideas welcome!',

The CashierCard is for any kind of worker, in any branche.<br/>
Just invite more people and keep printing and spreading the word!',
	
	'kk_faq_t11' => 'I have a great idea!',
	'kk_faq_b11' => 'Great, let us know! We also have dozens of ideas.<br/>
EineAn official ToDo is available here: %s.<br/>
You can also open a ticket or PullRequest on %s,

As a customer you can print %s stars per period.<br/>
A period is 2 days, and there are 3 periods per week; Mo/Di, We/Th and Fr/Sa.<br/>
This means an active customer could cost us around %s per month, but see the statistics in the left menu!<br/>
There is no printing on Sundays.<br/>
Partners and managers have special rules, of course.',
	
	'kk_faq_t14' => 'What are the stars and diamonds for?',
	'kk_faq_b14' => 'Stars can be created by customers out of thin air,
but they cannot use them except to give them to workers.<br/>
If a worker enters a coupon from you, you will get diamonds in return.<br/>
Diamonds have the same value of stars for customers, as they can exchange them for Offers.
Diamonds also put you into the rankings, where we can put some prizes or tombola up.<br/>
One â‚¬uro roghly equals %s stars. This rate may change!<br/>
Also, you can only trade the stars for the offers from our partners.
Diamonds are also used for the competitions,<br/>
like company, cashier, customer, offer, of, the, month.<br/>
Every redeemed offer earns the companies diamonds,
so they can compete for the most social company ever.<br/>
As a customer and cashier, you can earn diamonds by inviting more users.<br/>',

	'kk_faq_b15' => 'The lifetime of your stars is unlimited.<br/>
