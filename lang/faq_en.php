    'kk_faq_b1' => '%s is a service, and art project, to honor the cashiers and workers in the real economy.<br/>
It is similiar to a tip or a thank you.<br/>
Also it is the baptism of fire for my programming work.<br/>
KassiererCard.org has a fair reward system,
and we hope it is fun to earn Stars and redeem some of them into,<br/>
like getting a beer, a haircut, a kebab or a coffee.<br/>
In crazy times, maybe a thank you and a smile is more valuable than ever.<br/>
We are transparent and indipendant, and have kinda charity plans for the future.',

Customer, Cashier and Company.
Let\'s call them the three C\'s; CEO, Christian and Charlette.<br/>

Currently only admins can invite Cashiers individually.<br/>
We try to cover Peine and maybe one or two other cities in the first run.<br/>
If you like the idea, send invitations to your Customers. - Customers do not need a signup code.<br/>
You will get handed Coupons from your Customers that you can trade for goods from the Companies.<br/>
This can be done via exchanging a Coupon-Code, or scanning a QR-Code.<br/>
We hope you enjoy this a little!',
