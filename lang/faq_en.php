It is similiar to a tip or a thank you.<br/>
Also it is the baptism of fire for my programming work.<br/>
KassiererCard.org has a flexible point system and we hope it is fun to earn Coupons and redeem some of them into,<br/>
like getting a beer, a haircut, a kebab or a coffee.<br/>
In crazy times, maybe a thank you and a smile is more required than ever.<br/>',

    'kk_faq_t2' => 'How do we earn points?',

Customer, Cashier and Company.
Let\'s call them the three C\'s; CEO, Christian and Charlette.<br/>
Customers can print (and write down) Coupons.<br/>
The Cashiers and workers can trade them for Offers.<br/>
The Companies Offer goods for the trade Coupons, which might be a snack, some money off or a merchandize article, Anything is possible.',

    'kk_faq_t3' => 'The Customer 1x1',
    'kk_faq_b3' => 'As a customer;
Print Coupons and hand them to the Cashiers and workers you like.<br/>
You can print 1 Coupon every 2 days, meaning the periods are Mo/Tu, We/Th, Fr/Sa.<br/>
You can either print a Coupon, write the code down, or use your mobile phone to transfer your codes to the Cashiers,<br/>
Currently you get a customer coupon for every 5th Coupon your friends reedem.<br/>
It is not 100% clear yet what Customer Coupons will do.<br/>
Maybe a lottery, quite doubtful, or you will simply get the same Offers as a Cashier.<br/>
We are open to suggestions and feedback, but let\'s not forget it\'s for them, not for you!',

    'kk_faq_t4' => 'The Cashier Crisis',
    'kk_faq_b4' => 'Let\'s not forget we do this for you, dear workers.<br/>
Currently only admins can invite Cashiers individually.<br/>
We try to cover Peine and maybe one or two other cities in the first run.<br/>
If you like the idea, send invitations to your Customers. - Customers do not need a signup code.<br/>
You will get handed Coupons from your Customers that you can trade for goods from the Companies.<br/>
This can be done via exchanging a Coupon-Code, or scanning a QR-Code.<br/>
We hope you enjoy this a little!',

    'kk_faq_t5' => 'The Company Cookbook',
    'kk_faq_b5' => 'Last but not least, there are Compenies.<br/>
Your job is to give your workers a bit money and products.<br/>
In exchange you will get 100% off the backside of every printed KassiererCard,<br/>
a merchandize platform that is not poisoned with bloated metrics.<br/>',

Just invite more people and keep printing and spreading the word!',

EineAn official ToDo is available here: %s.<br/>
You can also open a ticket or PullRequest on %s,

	'kk_faq_b13' => 'Cards can get printed by customers, managers, partners and above. No cashiers.<br/>
As a customer you can print %s stars per period.<br/>
A period is 2 days, and there are 3 periods per week; Mo/Di, We/Th and Fr/Sa.<br/>
This means an active customer could cost us %s per month, but see the statistics in the left menu!<br/>
There is no printing on Sundays.<br/>
Partners and managers have special rules, of course.',
