<h2>Welcome to <?=sitename()?></h2>

<p>You know <a href="https://www.payback.de/" rel="nofollow">Payback Card</a>.</p>
<p>You know <a href="https://www.deutschlandcard.de/" rel="nofollow">Deutschland Card</a>.</p>
<p>And many more...</p>

<p>So, what do these systems have in common?</p>
<p>Right, they are about the customer.
No one ever thinks of the workers.
The cashiers, the drivers, the cleaning personal,
and maybe even some managers.</p>

<p>This is were <a href="https://kassierercard.org">KassiererCard.org</a> steps in.
Our bonus program is focused to aid the people who keep the business running,
often for the minimum wage.</p>

<p>If you wanna help your local employees, 
<?=GDT_Link::anchor(href('Register','Form'), 'register')?>
and give them credit, where credit is due.</p>

<p>On the left sidebar you find public resources,
to the right are private.<br/>
To register as a cashier or a companym you need a special Signup-Code.<br/>
If you register as customer you can print 1 coupon all 2 days,
and hand them to your cashiers.
